# DreamRose-Lenders
To run this project pull down from github and run in visual studio. The needed CSV file will be included in the files needed to enable you to run and test the program.
This repo will contain code for sorting Lenders by which state they loan in.
It will pull the lenders from a CSV file and return a list with the company name, contact person and phone number.
The required features that I believe I have met in this project are as follows:
  My project has been uploaded to github more than 5 times during the process of creating it.
  It includes this readme file and when running the program it will ask you to enter a state to get a loan in. If a state is entered that is not found no lenders will be   listed. If it finds a lender in that state it will give the lenders name, phone number and if a contact name is available it will give the name. If no contact name is   found it will say "no name found"
  I have created more than one class and populated data for at least one of them. Which is displayed when the program is run and user input is read.
  I have included a do loop, if else statement and query in my program.
  I have created three working tests for my program.
  I have created both a list of lenders and array of states.
  My project pulls from a csv data file and displays it on a console app.
  It analayzes data looking for state requested and displays the accurate lenders for that state on the console app.
In the future I will expand the program to search by loan type and loan range(this will not be included at this time).
